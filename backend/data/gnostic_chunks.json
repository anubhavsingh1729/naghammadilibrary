anything to him about this, except only that there is a limit to speech set in the Pleroma, so that they are silent about the incomprehensibility of the Father, but they speak about the one who wishes to comprehend him.", "It came to one of the aeons that he should attempt to grasp the incomprehensibility and give glory to it and especially to the ineffability of the Father.", "Since he is a Logos of the unity, he is one, though he is not from the agreement of the Totalities, nor from him who brought them forth, namely, the one who brought forth the Totality, the Father.", "This aeon was among those to whom was given wisdom, so that he could become pre-existent in each one's thought.", "By that which he wills, will they be produced.", "Therefore, he received a wise nature in order to examine the hidden basis, since he is a wise fruit; for, the free will which was begotten with the Totalities was a cause for this one, such as to make him do what he desired, with no one to restrain him.", "The intent, then, of the Logos, who is this one, was good.", "When he had come forth, he gave glory to the Father, even if it led to something beyond possibility, since he had wanted to bring forth one who is perfect, from an agreement in which he had not been, and without having the command.", "This aeon was last to have <been> brought forth by mutual assistance, and he was small in magnitude.", "And before he begot anything else for the glory of the will and in agreement with the Totalities, he acted, magnanimously, from an abundant love, and set out toward that which surrounds the perfect glory, for it was not without the will of the Father that the Logos was produced, which is to say, not without it will he go forth.", "But he, the Father, had brought him forth for those about whom he knew that it was fitting that they should come into being.", "The Father and the Totalities drew away from him, so that the limit which the Father had set might be established - for it is not from grasping the incomprehensibility but by the will of the Father, - and furthermore, (they withdrew) so that the things which have come to be might become an organization which would come into being.", "If it were to come, it would not come into being by the manifestation of the Pleroma.", "Therefore, it is not fitting to criticize the movement which is the Logos, but it is fitting that we should say about the movement of the Logos that it is a cause of an organization which has been destined to come about.", "The Logos himself caused it to happen, being complete and unitary, for the glory of the Father, whom he desired, and (he did so) being content with it, but those whom he wished to take hold of firmly he begot in shadows and copies and likenesses.", "For, he was not able to bear the sight of the light, but he looked into the depth and he doubted.", "Out of this there was a division - he became deeply troubled - and a turning away because of his self-doubt and division, forgetfulness and ignorance of himself and <of that> which is.", "His self-exaltation and his expectation of comprehending the incomprehensible became firm for him and was in him.", "But the sicknesses followed him when he went beyond himself, having come into being from self-doubt, namely from the fact that he did not <reach the attainment of> the glories of the Father, the one whose exalted status is among things unlimited.", "This one did not attain him, for he did not receive him.", "The one whom he himself brought forth as a unitary aeon rushed up to that which is his and this kin of his in the Pleroma abandoned him who came to be in the defect along with those who had come forth from him in an imaginary way, since they are not his.", "When he who produced himself as perfect actually did bring himself forth, he became weak like a female nature which has abandoned its virile counterpart.", "From that which was deficient in itself there came those things which came into being from his thought and his arrogance, but from that which is perfect in him he left it and raised himself up to those who are his.", "He was in the Pleroma as a remembrance for him so that he would be saved from his arrogance.", "The one who ran on high and the one who drew him to himself were not barren, but in bringing forth a fruit in the Pleroma, they upset those who were in the defect.", "Like the Pleromas are the things which came into being from the arrogant thought, which are their (the Pleromas') likenesses, copies, shadows, and phantasms, lacking reason and the light, these which belong to the vain thought, since they are not products of anything.", "Therefore, their end will be like their beginning: from that which did not exist (they are) to return once again to that which will not be.", "It is they, however, by themselves who are greater, more powerful, and more honored than the names which are given to them, which are their shadows.", "In the manner of a reflection are they beautiful.", "For the face of the copy normally takes its beauty from that of which it is a copy.", "They thought of themselves that they are beings existing by themselves and are without a source, since they do not see anything else existing before them.", "Therefore, they lived in disobedience and acts of rebellion, without having humbled themselves before the one because of whom they came into being.", "They wanted to command one another, overcoming one another in their vain ambition, while the glory which they possess contains a cause of the system which was to be.", "They are likenesses of the things which are exalted.", "They were brought to a lust for power in each one of them, according to the greatness of the name of which each is a shadow, each one imagining that it is superior to his fellows.", "The thought of these others was not barren, but just like <those> of which they are shadows, all that they thought about they have as potential sons; those of whom they thought they had as offspring.", "Therefore, it happened that many offspring came forth from them, as fighters, as warriors, as troublemakers, as apostates.", "They are disobedient beings, lovers of power.", "All the other beings of this sort were brought forth from these.", "7.", "The Conversion of the Logos The Logos was a cause of those who came into being and he continued all the more to be at a loss and he was astonished.", "Instead of perfection, he saw a defect; instead of unification, he saw division; instead of stability, he saw disturbances; instead of rests, tumults.", "Neither was it possible for him to make them cease from loving disturbance, nor was it possible for him to destroy it.", "He was completely powerless, once his totality and his exaltation abandoned him.", "Those who had come into being not knowing themselves both did not know the Pleromas from which they came forth and did not know the one who was the cause of their existence.", "The Logos, being in such unstable conditions, did not continue to bring forth anything like emanations, the things which are in the Pleroma, the glories which exist for the honor of the Father.", "Rather, he brought forth little weaklings, hindered) by the illnesses by which he too was hindered.", "It was the likeness of the disposition which was a unity, that which was the cause of the things which do not themselves exist from the first.", "Until the one who brought forth into the defect these things which were thus in need, until he judged those who came into being because of him contrary to reason - which is the judgment which became a condemnation - he struggled against them unto destruction, that is, the ones who struggled against the condemnation and whom the wrath pursues, while it (the wrath) accepts and redeems (them) from their (false) opinion and apostasy, since from it is the conversion which is also called \"metanoia.\"", "The Logos turned to another opinion and another thought.", "Having turned away from evil, he turned toward the good things.", "Following the conversion came the thought of the things which exist and the prayer for the one who converted himself to the good.", "The one who is in the Pleroma was what he first prayed to and remembered; then (he remembered) his brothers individually and (yet) always with one another; then all of them together; but before all of them, the Father.", "The prayer of the agreement was a help for him in his own return and (in that of) the Totality, for a cause of his remembering those who have existed from the first was his being remembered.", "This is the thought which calls out from afar, bringing him back.", "All his prayer and remembering were numerous powers according to that limit.", "For there is nothing barren in his thought.", "The powers were good and were greater than those of the likeness.", "For those belonging to the likeness also belong to a nature of falsehood.", "From an illusion of similarity and a thought of arrogance has come about that which they became.", "And they originate from the thought which first knew them.", "To what do the former beings pertain?", "They are like forgetfulness and heavy sleep; being like those who dream troubled dreams, to whom sleep comes while they - those who dream - are oppressed.", "The others are like some creatures of light for him, looking for the rising of the sun, since it happened that they saw in him dreams which are truly sweet.", "It immediately put a stop to the emanations of the thought.", "They did not any longer have their substance and also they did not have honor any longer.", "Though he is not equal to those who pre-existed, if they were superior to the likenesses, it was he alone through whom they were more exalted than those, for they are not from a good intent.", "It was not from the sickness which came into being that they were produced, from which is the good intent, but (from) the one who sought after the pre-existent.", "Once he had prayed, he both raised himself to the good and sowed in them a pre-disposition to seek and pray to the glorious pre-existent one, and he sowed in them a thought about him and an idea, so that they should think that something greater than themselves exists prior to them, although they did not understand what it was.", "Begetting harmony and mutual love through that thought, they acted in unity and unanimity, since from unity and from unanimity they have received their very being.", "They were stronger than them in the lust for power, for they were more honored than the first ones, who had been raised above them.", "Those had not humbled themselves.", "They thought about themselves that they were beings originating from themselves alone and were without a source.", "As they brought forth at first according to their own birth, the two orders assaulted one another, fighting for command because of their manner of being.", "As a result, they were submerged in forces and natures in accord with the condition of mutual assault, having lust for power and all other things of this sort.", "It is from these that the vain love of glory draws all of them to the desire of the lust for power, while none of them has the exalted thought nor acknowledges it.", "The powers of this thought are prepared in the works of the pre-existent <ones>, those of which they are the representations.", "For the order of those of this sort had mutual harmony, but it fought against the order of those of the likeness, while the order of those of the likeness wages war against the representations and acts against it alone, because of its wrath.", "From this it [...] them [...] one another, many [...] necessity appointed them [...] and might prevail [...] was not a multitude, [...] and their envy and their [...] and their wrath and violence and desire and prevailing ignorance produce empty matters and powers of various sorts, mixed in great number with one another; while the mind of the Logos, who was a cause of their begetting, was open to a revelation of the hope which would come to him from above.", "8.", "The Emanation of the Savior The Logos which moved had the hope and the expectation of him who is exalted.", "As for those of the shadow, he separated himself from them in every way, since they fight against him and are not at all humble before him.", "He was content with the beings of the thought.", "And as for the one who is set up in this way and who is within the exalted boundary, remembering the one who is defective, the Logos brought him forth in an invisible way, among those who came into being according to the thought, according to the one who was with them, until the light shone upon him from above as a lifegiver, the one who was begotten by the thought of brotherly love of the pre-existent Pleromas.", "The stumbling, which happened to the aeons of the Father of the Totalities who did not suffer, was brought to them, as if it were their own, in a careful and non-malicious and immensely sweet way.", "It was brought to the Totalities so that they might be instructed about the defect by the single one, from whom alone they all received strength to eliminate the defects.", "The order which was his came into being from him who ran on high and that which brought itself forth from him and from the entire perfection.", "The one who ran on high became for the one who was defective an intercessor with the emanation of the aeons which had come into being in accord with the things which exist.", "When he prayed to them, they consented joyously and willingly, since they were in agreement, and with harmonious consent, to aid the defective one.", "They gathered together, asking the Father with beneficent intent that there be aid from above, from the Father, for his glory, since the defective one could not become perfect in any other way, unless it was the will of the Pleroma of the Father, which he had drawn to himself, revealed, and given to the defective one.", "Then from the harmony, in a joyous willingness which had come into being, they brought forth the fruit, which was a begetting from the harmony, a unity, a possession of the Totalities, revealing the countenance of the Father, of whom the aeons thought as they gave glory and prayed for help for their brother with a wish in which the Father counted himself with them.", "Thus, it was willingly and gladly that they bring forth the fruit.", "And he made manifest the agreement of the revelation of his union with them, which is his beloved Son.",

appointed,\" in accordance with the ones from whom he was brought forth, since he has become the names of the positions which were given to him.", "Yet, what other name may be applied to him except

he had prayed for help.", "He also sees the one who gave it to him.", "The fruit of the agreement with him, of which we previously spoke, is subject to the power of the Totalities.", "For the Father has set the Totalities within him, both the ones which pre-exist and the ones which are, and the ones which will be.", "He was capable (of doing it).", "He revealed those which he had placed within him.", "He did not give them, when he entrusted them to him.", "He directed the organization of the universe according to the authority which was given him from the first and (according to) the power of the task.", "Thus, he began and effected his revelation.", "The one in whom the Father is and the one in whom the Totalities are <was> created before the one who lacked sight.", "He instructed him about those who searched for their sight, by means of the shining of that perfect light.", "He first perfected him in ineffable joy.", "He perfected him for himself as a perfect one and he also gave him what is appropriate to each individual.", "For this is the determination of the first joy.", "And <he> sowed in him in an invisible way a word which is destined to be knowledge.", "And he gave him power to separate and cast out from himself those who are disobedient to him.", "Thus, he made himself manifest to him.", "But to those who came into being because of him he revealed a form surpassing them.", "They acted in a hostile way toward one another.", "Suddenly he revealed himself to them, approaching them in the form of lightning.", "And in putting an end to the entanglement which they have with one another he stopped it by the sudden revelation, which they were not informed about, did not expect, and did not know of.", "Because of this, they were afraid and fell down, since they

against them.", "The beings of the likeness, however, were exceedingly afraid, since they were not able to hear about him in the beginning, that there is a vision of this sort.", "Therefore they fell down to the pit of ignorance which is called \"the Outer Darkness,\" and \"Chaos\" and \"Hades\" and \"the Abyss.\"", "He set up what was beneath the order of the beings of thought, as it was stronger than they.", "They were worthy of ruling over the unspeakable darkness, since it is theirs and is the lot which was assigned to them.", "He granted them that they, too, should be of use for the organization which was to come, to which he had assigned them.", "There is a great difference between the revelation of the one who came into being to the one who was defective and to those things which are to come into being because of him.", "For he revealed himself to him within him, since he is with him, is a fellow sufferer with him, gives him rest little by little, makes him grow, lifts him up, gives himself to him completely for enjoyment from a vision.", "But to those who fall outside, he revealed himself quickly and in a striking way and he withdrew to himself suddenly without having let them see him.", "9.", "The Pleroma of the Logos When the Logos which was defective was illumined, his Pleroma began.", "He escaped those who had disturbed him at first.", "He became unmixed

rejoiced over the visitation of his brothers who had visited him.", "He gave glory and praise to those who had become manifest as a help to him, while he gave thanks, because he had escaped those who revolted against him, and admired and honored the greatness and those who had appeared to him in a determined way.", "He generated manifest images of the living visages, pleasing among things which are good, existing among the things which exist, resembling them in beauty, but unequal to them in truth, since they are not from an agreement with him, between the one who brought them forth and the one who revealed himself to him.", "But in wisdom and knowledge he acts, mingling the Logos with him(self) entirely.", "Therefore, those which came forth from him are great, just as that which is truly great.", "After he was amazed at the beauty of the ones who had appeared to him, he professed gratitude for this visitation.", "The Logos performed this activity, through those from whom he had received aid, for the stability of those who had come into being because of him and so that they might receive something good, since he thought to pray for the organization of all those who came forth from him, which is stabilized, so that it might make them established.", "Therefore, those whom he intentionally produced are in chariots, just as those who came into being, those who have appeared,

brought forth.", "The Logos added even more to their mutual assistance and to the hope of the promise, since they have joy and abundant rest and undefiled pleasures.", "He generated those whom he remembered at first, when they were not with him, (he generated them) having the perfection.", "Dittography Now, while he who belongs to the vision is with him, he exists in hope and faith in the perfect Father, as much as the Totalities.", "He appears to him before he mingles with him, in order that the things which have come into being might not perish by looking upon the light, for they cannot accept the great, exalted stature.", "The thought of the Logos, who had returned to his stability and ruled over those who had come into being because of him, was called \"Aeon\" and \"Place\"

thought, and returned to the single thought.", "Similarly, it is called \"Storehouse,\" because of the rest which he obtained, giving (it) to himself alone.", "And it is also called \"Bride,\" because

attentiveness and the promise concerning the things for which he asked.", "It had the designation of the Son and his essence and his power and his form, who is the one whom he loved and in whom he was pleased, who was entreated in a loving way.", "It was light and was a desire to be established and an openness for instruction and an eye for vision, qualities which it had from the exalted ones.",

form with him, but according to the image of the Pleroma, having their fathers who are the ones who gave them life, each one being a copy of each one of the faces, which are forms of maleness, since

place of the Church which assembles in this place, having the form of the Church which exists in the aeons, which glorifies the Father.", "After these (he beautified) the place of the faith and obedience (which arises) from hope, which things the Logos received when the light appeared; then (he beautified the place of) the disposition, which is prayer and supplication, which were followed by forgiveness and the word concerning the one who would appear.", "All the spiritual places are in spiritual power.", "They are separate from the beings of the thought, since the power is established in an image, which is that which separates the Pleroma from the Logos, while the power which is active in prophesying about the things which will be, directs the beings of the thought which have come

stripped from himself, desiring to draw them into a material union, for the sake of their system and dwelling place, and in order that they might also bring forth an impulse for diminution from their attraction to evil, so that they might not any more rejoice in the glory of their environment and be dissolved, but might rather see their sickness in which they suffer, so that they might beget love and continuous searching after the one who is able to heal them of the inferiority.", "Also over those who belong to the likeness, he set the word of beauty, so that he might bring them into a form.",

the imprints, because of the thought which is connected with them, which is like a shadow and a garment, so to speak, because he does not see in what way the things which exist actually do exist.", "He established workers and servants, assisting in what he will do and what he will say, for in every place where he worked he left his countenance in his beautiful name, effecting and speaking of the things which he thinks about.", "He established in his place images of the light which appeared and of those things which are spiritual, though they were of his own essence.", "For, thus they were honored in every place by him, being pure, from the countenance of the one who appointed them, and they were established: paradises and kingdoms and rests and promises and multitudes of servants of his will, and though they are lords of dominions, they are set beneath the one who is lord, the one who appointed them.", "After he listened to him in this way, properly, about the lights, which are the source and the system, he set them over the beauty of the things below.", "The invisible spirit moved him in this way, so that he would wish to administer through his own servant, whom he too used, as a hand and as a mouth and as if he were his face, (and his servant is) the things which he brings, order and threat and fear, in order that those with whom he has done what is ignorant might despise the order which was given for them to keep, since they are fettered in the bonds of the archons, which are on them securely.", "The whole establishment of matter is divided into three.", "The strong powers which the spiritual Logos brought forth from fantasy and arrogance, he established in the first spiritual rank.", "Then those (powers) which these produced by their lust for power, he set in the middle area, since they are powers of ambition, so that they might exercise dominion and give commands with compulsion and force to the establishment which is beneath them.", "Those which came into being through envy and jealousy, and all the other offspring from dispositions of this sort, he set in a servile order controlling the extremities, commanding all those which exist and all (the realm of) generation, from whom come rapidly destroying illnesses, who eagerly desire begetting, who are something in the place where they are from and to which they will return.", "And therefore, he appointed over them authoritative powers, acting continuously on matter, in order that the offspring of those which exist might also exist continuously.", "For this is their glory.",

projection of theirs, like a shadow cast from and following a body, those things which are the roots of the visible creations, namely, the entire preparation of the adornment of the images and representations and likenesses, have come into being because of those who need education and teaching and formation, so that the smallness might grow, little by little, as through a mirror image.",

mankind as well.", "The spiritual Logos moved him invisibly, as he perfected him through the Demiurge and his angelic servants, who shared in the act of fashioning in multitudes, when he took counsel with his archons.", "Like a shadow is earthly man, so that he might be like those who are cut off from the Totalities.", "Also he is something prepared by all of them, those of the right and those of the left, since each one in the orders gives a form to the [...] in which it exists.", "The [...] which the Logos who was defective brought forth, who was in the sickness, did not resemble him, because he brought it forth forgetfully, ignorantly, and defectively, and in all the other weak ways, although the Logos gave the first form through the Demiurge out of ignorance, so that he would learn that the exalted one exists, and would know that he needs him.", "This is what the prophet called \"Living Spirit\" and \"Breath of the exalted aeons\" and \"the Invisible,\" and this is the living soul which has given life to the power which was dead at first.", "For that which is dead is ignorance.", "It is fitting that we explain about the soul of the first human being, that it is from the spiritual Logos, while the creator thinks that it is his, since it is from him, as from a mouth through which one breathes.", "The creator also sent down souls from his substance, since he, too, has a power of procreation, because he is something which has come into being from the representation of the Father.", "Also those of the left brought forth, as it were, men of their own, since they have the likeness of <being>.", "The spiritual substance is a single thing and a single representation, and its weakness is the determination in many forms.", "As for the substance of the psychics, its determination is double, since it has the knowledge and the confession of the exalted one, and it is not inclined to evil, because of the inclination of the thought.", "As for the material substance, its way is different and in many forms, and it was a weakness which existed in many types of inclination.", "The first human being is a mixed formation, and a mixed creation, and a deposit of those of the left and those of the right, and a spiritual word whose attention is divided between each of the two substances from which he takes his being.", "Therefore, it is said that a paradise was planted for him, so that he might eat of the food of three kinds of tree, since it is a garden of the threefold order, and since it is that which gives enjoyment.", "The noble elect substance which is in him was more exalted.", "It created and it did not wound them.", "Therefore they issued a command, making a threat and bringing upon him a great danger, which is death.", "Only the enjoyment of the things which are evil did he allow him to taste, and from the other tree with the double (fruit) he did not allow him to eat, much less from the tree of life, so that they would not acquire honor [...] them, and so that they would not be [...] by the evil power which is called \"the serpent.\"", "And he is more cunning than all the evil powers.", "He led man astray through the determination of those things which belong to the thought and the desires.", "<He> made him transgress the command, so that he would die.", "And he was expelled from every enjoyment of that place.", "This is the expulsion which was made for him, when he was expelled from the enjoyments of the things which belong to the likeness and those of the representation.", "It was a work of providence, so that it might be found that it is a short time until man will receive the enjoyment of the things which are eternally good, in which is the place of rest.", "This the spirit ordained when he first planned that man should experience the great evil, which is death, that is complete ignorance of the Totality, and that he should experience all the evils which come from this and, after the deprivations and cares which are in these, that he should receive of the greatest good, which is life eternal, that is, firm knowledge of the Totalities and the reception of all good things.",

organization of the Father's will, of which we spoke previously.", "Part III 12.", "The Variety of Theologies If both the orders, those on the right and those on the left, are brought together with one another by the thought which is set between them, which gives them their organization with each other, it happens that they both act with the same emulation of their deeds, with those of the right resembling those of the left, and those of the left resembling those of the right.", "And if at times the evil order begins to do evil in a foolish way, the <wise> order emulates, in the form of a man of violence, also doing what is evil, as if it were a power of a man of violence.", "At other times the foolish order attempts to do good, making itself like it, since the hidden order, too, is zealous to do it.", "Just as it is in the things which are established, so (it is) in the things which have come to be.", "Since they bring things unlike one another, those who were not instructed

come from these, in accord with the mutual conflict and rebellious manner active in them, also spoke in a likely, arrogant and imaginary way concerning the things which they thought of as wisdom,

themselves seem to hinder them, as if they were the Totality.", "Therefore, the order was caught up in fighting itself alone, because of the arrogant hostility of one of the offspring of the archon who is superior, who exists before him.", "Therefore, nothing was in agreement with its fellows, nothing, neither philosophy nor types of medicine nor types of rhetoric nor types of music nor types of logic, but they are opinions and theories.", "Ineffability held sway in confusion, because of the indescribable quality of those who hold sway, who give them thoughts.", "Now, as for the things which

we already spoke, namely the righteous ones and the prophets, did not think of anything and did not say anything from imagination or through a likeness or from esoteric thinking, but each one by the power which was at work in him, and while listening to the things which he saw and heard, spoke of them in [...].", "They have a unified harmony with one another after the manner of those who worked

things.", "They too intended to come.", "When they thought of the Savior they came, and they came when he knew; they also came more exalted in the emanation according to the flesh than those who had

productions in accordance with the organization and <the> Savior, who did not share in the passions?", "The Savior was an image of the unitary one, he who is the Totality in bodily form.", "Therefore, he preserved the form of indivisibility, from which comes impassability.", "They, however, are images of each thing which became manifest.", "Therefore, they assume division from the pattern, having taken form for the planting which exists beneath the heaven.", "This also is what shares in the evil which exists in the places which they have reached.", "For the will held the Totality under sin, so

hesitated) even more to run toward him in faith.", "Rather, through a voice it was instructed, and this was sufficient, since it is not far from the hope according to the promise, since it received, so to speak as a pledge, the assurance of the things which were to be.", "The material race, however, is alien in every way; since it is dark, it shuns the shining of the light, because its appearance

being.", "Those, however, who are from the thought of lust for power, who have come into being from the blow of those who fight against him, those whom the thought brought forth, from these, since they are mixed, they will receive their end suddenly.", "Those who will be brought forth from the lust for power which is given to them for a time and for certain periods, and who will give glory to the Lord of glory, and who will relinquish their wrath, they will receive the reward for their humility, which is to remain forever.", "Those, however, who are proud because of the desire of ambition,

God is the Lord of all and Savior, and were not brought out of wrath and the resemblance to the evil ones, they will receive judgment for their ignorance and their senselessness, which is suffering,

including his death.", "They persevered saying, \"We shall become rulers of the universe, if the one who has been proclaimed king of the universe is slain,\" (they said this) when they labored to do

to the church and the song of those who are humble along with her to the full extent possible, in that which is pleasing to do for her, in sharing in her sufferings and her pains in the manner of those who understand what is good for the church, they will have a share in her hope.", "This is to be said on the subject of how men and angels who are from the order of the left have a path to error: not only did they deny the Lord and plot evil against him, but also toward the Church did they direct their hatred and envy and jealousy; and this is the reason for the condemnation of those who have moved and have aroused themselves for the trials of the Church.", "15.", "The Process of Restoration The election shares body and essence with the Savior, since it is like a bridal chamber

are glad and happy at the union of the bridegroom and the bride.", "The place which the calling will have is the aeon of the images, where the Logos has not yet joined with the Pleroma.", "And since the man of the Church was happy and glad at this, as he was hoping for it, he separated spirit, soul, and body in the organization of the one who thinks that he is a unity, though within him is the man who is the Totality - and he is all of them.", "And, though he has the escape from the [...] which the places will receive, he also has the members about which we spoke earlier.", "When the redemption was proclaimed, the perfect man received knowledge immediately, so as to return in haste to his unitary state, to the place from which he came, to return there joyfully, to the place from which he came, to the place from which he flowed forth.", "His members, however, needed a place of instruction, which is in the places which are adorned, so that they might receive from them

countenance in accordance with him.", "The restoration is at the end, after the Totality reveals what it is, the Son, who is the redemption, that is, the path toward the incomprehensible Father, that is, the return to the pre-existent, and (after) the Totalities reveal themselves in that one, in the proper way, who is the inconceivable one and the ineffable one, and the invisible one and the incomprehensible one, so that it receives redemption.", "It was not only release from the domination of the left ones, nor was it only escape from the power of those of the right, to each of which we thought that were slaves and sons, from whom none escapes without quickly becoming theirs again, but the redemption also is an ascent to the degrees which are in the Pleroma and to those who have named themselves and who conceive of themselves according to the power of each of the aeons, and (it is) an entrance into what is silent, where there is no need for voice nor for knowing, nor for forming a concept, nor for illumination, but (where) all things are light, while they do not need to be illumined.", "Not only do humans need redemption, but also the angels, too, need redemption, along with the image and the rest of the Pleromas of the aeons and the wondrous powers of illumination.", "So that we might not be in doubt in regard to the others, even the Son himself, who has the position of redeemer of the Totality, needed redemption as well, - he who had become man, - since he gave himself for each thing which we need, we in the flesh, who are his Church.", "Now, when he first received redemption from the word which had descended upon him, all the rest received redemption from him, namely those who had taken him to themselves.", "For those who received the one who had received (redemption) also received what was in him.", "Among the men who are in the flesh redemption began to be given, his first-born, and his love, the Son who was incarnate, while the angels who are in heaven asked to associate, so that they might form an association with him upon the earth.", "Therefore, he is called \"the Redemption of the angels of the Father,\" he who comforted those who were laboring under the Totality for his knowledge, because he was given the grace before anyone else.", "The Father had foreknowledge of him, since he was in his thought before anything came into being, and since he had those to whom he has revealed him.", "He set the deficiency on the one who remains for certain periods and times, as a glory for his Pleroma, since the fact that he is unknown is a cause of his production from his agreement [...] of him.", "Just as reception of knowledge of him is a manifestation of his lack of envy and the revelation of the abundance of his sweetness, which is the second glory, so, too, he has been found to be a cause of ignorance, although he is also a begetter of knowledge.", "In a hidden and incomprehensible wisdom he kept the knowledge to the end, until the Totalities became weary while searching for God the Father, whom no one found through his own wisdom or power.", "He gives himself, so that they might receive knowledge of the abundant thought about his great glory, which he has given, and (about) the cause, which he has given, which is his unceasing thanksgiving, he who, from the immobility of his counsel, reveals himself eternally to those who have been worthy of the Father, who is unknown in his nature, so that they might receive knowledge of him, through his desire that they should come to experience the ignorance and its pains.", "Those of whom he first thought that they should attain knowledge and the good things which are in it, they were planning - which is the wisdom of the Father, - that they might experience the evil things and might train themselves in them, as a [...] for a time, so that they might receive the enjoyment of good things for eternity.", "They hold change and persistent renunciation and the cause of those who fight against them as an adornment and marvelous quality of those who are exalted, so that it is manifest that the ignorance of those who will be ignorant of the Father was something of their own.", "He who gave them knowledge of him was one of his powers for enabling them to grasp that knowledge in the fullest sense is called \"the knowledge of all that which is thought of\" and \"the treasure\" and \"the addition for the increase of knowledge,\" \"the revelation of those things which were known at first,\" and \"the path toward harmony and toward the pre-existent one,\" which is the increase of those who have abandoned the greatness which was theirs in the organization of the will, so that the end might be like the beginning.", "As for the baptism which exists in the fullest sense, into which the Totalities will descend and in which they will be, there is no other baptism apart from this one alone, which is the redemption into God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, when confession is made through faith in those names, which are a single name of the gospel, when they have come to believe what has been said to them, namely that they exist.", "From this they have their salvation, those who have believed that they exist.", "This is attaining in an invisible way to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in an undoubting faith.", "And when they have borne witness to them, it is also with a firm hope that they attained them, so that the return to them might become the perfection of those who have believed in them and (so that) the Father might be one with them, the Father, the God, whom they have confessed in faith and who gave (them) their union with him in knowledge.", "The baptism which we previously mentioned is called \"garment of those who do not strip themselves of it,\" for those who will put it on and those who have received redemption wear it.", "It is also called \"the confirmation of the truth which has no fall.\"", "In an unwavering and immovable way it grasps those who have received the restoration while they grasp it.", "(Baptism) is called \"silence\" because of the quiet and the tranquility.", "It is also called \"bridal chamber\" because of the agreement and the indivisible state of those who know they have known him.", "It is also called \"the light which does not set and is without flame,\" since it does not give light, but those who have worn it are made into light.", "They are the ones whom he wore.", "(Baptism) is also called \"the eternal life,\" which is immortality; and it is called \"that which is, entirely, simply, in the proper sense, what is pleasing, inseparably and irremovably and faultlessly and imperturbably, for the one who exists for those who have received a beginning.\"", "For, what else is there to name it apart from \"God,\" since it is the Totalities, that is, even if it is given numberless names, they are spoken simply as a reference to it.", "Just as he transcends every word, and he transcends every voice, and he transcends every mind, and he transcends everything, and he transcends every silence, so it is Dittography with those who are that which he is.", "This is

preceded at some length, how have we spoken?", "In a partial way, - since I said about all those who came forth from the Logos, either from the judgment of the evil ones or from the wrath which fights against them and the turning away from them, which is the return to the exalted ones, or from the prayer and the remembrance of those who pre-existed, or from hope and faith that they would receive their salvation from good work, since they have been deemed worthy because they are beings from the good dispositions, (that) they have cause of their begetting which is an opinion from the one who exists.", "Still further (I said) that before the Logos concerned himself with them in an invisible way, willingly, the exalted one added to this thought, because they were in need of him, who was the
