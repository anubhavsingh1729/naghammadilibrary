On the Baptism A -- A Translated by John D. Turner :
 This is the fullness of the summary of knowledge which summary was revealed 
to us by our Lord Jesus Christ, the Monogenes. These are the sure and necessary items
so that we may walk in them. But they are those of the first baptism [......The First] baptism
is the Forgiveness of sins [...] said, [...] you to the [...] your sins the [...] is a pattern of the
[...] of the Christ which is the equal of the [..within] him [...]. For the [...] of Jesus [...].
Moreover, the first baptism is the forgiveness of sins. We are brought from those of the right, that is,  into the imperishability which is the Jordan. But that place is of the world. So we have been
sent out of the world into the Aeon. For the interpretation of John is the Aeon, while the interpretation
of that which is the upward progression, that is, our Exodus from the world into the Aeon.
